        The crisp autumn air filled the park as the leaves rustled underfoot.
        A light breeze carried the scent of woodsmoke and wet earth. The sun was just beginning to
        dip below the treeline, casting long shadows across the grass
        and illuminating the colorful foliage. People of all ages strolled along the paths, admiring
        the beauty of the season.
